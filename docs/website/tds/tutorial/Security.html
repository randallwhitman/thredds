  <h3>Be afraid</h3>

<div id="section">
  <h2><a name="versions">Keeping Software Versions Up-To-Date</a></h2>

  <h3>Rationale</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Running the most current versions of software keeps your environment protected against <em>known</em>
      <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/vulnerabilities">security vulnerabilities</a>. This includes the JDK, Tomcat, the TDS and any other third-party
      libraries or software you run.
    </li>
    <li>Stay Informed! Subscribe to announcement lists for Tomcat, the TDS and any other software you deploy, to stay abreast of new versions released due to
      security issues.
    </li>
    <li>As soon as a security issue is disclosed, potential attackers will begin trying to exploit that vulnerability. It is important that you upgrade your
      software before an attacker uses the vulnerability against you.

  <h2><a name="install">Tomcat Process User/Group and ${tomcat_home} Permissions</a></h2>

  <h3>Rationale</h3>

  <div id="note" class="info">
    <h4>Background info</h4>

    <p>The JVM doesn't fork at all, nor does it support <code>setuid()</code> calls. The JVM, and therefore Tomcat, is one process. The JVM is a virtual machine
      with many threads under the same process. </p>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Because of OS constraints, all threads in the same JVM process must run under the same user id. No thread may run as the <code>root</code> user unless
      they are all are run as the <code>root</code> user. Hence, any programs run in Tomcat (TDS, <code>manager</code> application, other JSPs and servlets)
      will run as the <code>root</code> user.
    </li>
    <li>If you choose to run the Tomcat process as the <code>root</code> user, and an attacker manages to exploit a weakness in Tomcat or something running in
      <code>webapps/</code> to run arbitrary commands, <em>those commands will be run as the superuser</em>!
    </li>
    <li>We <em>strongly discourage</em> running Tomcat as the <code>root</code> user and recommend creating an unprivileged, dedicated user and group for running
      the Tomcat process.

      <a id="tomcatUserAndGroup" class="example">
        Create a dedicated user and group for running Tomcat
      </a>


    </li>
    <li>We also recommend restricting the permissions of the Tomcat user/group within <code>${tomcat_home}</code>.


      <a id="tomcatHomePerms" class="example">
        Restrict the permissions in <code>${tomcat_home}</code>
      </a>

<div id="section">
  <h2><a name="unused">Removing Unused Web Applications</a></h2>


  <h3>Rationale</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>It is generally good practice to remove any un-used web applications out of <code>${tomcat_home}/webapps</code>.</li>
    <li>Tomcat "ships" with several default web applications you may want to consider removing if they are not being utilized:</li>
    <ul class="little">
      <li>The <code>ROOT</code> application is Tomcat's <code>DocumentRoot</code> and contains the server's main web page. Give thought to the content that is
        placed in <code>ROOT/</code>, as it will be readily available. (Note: if you want to utilize a <code>robots.txt</code> file to restrict crawler
        activity, <code>ROOT/</code> is the place it will go.)
      </li>
      <li>The <code>manager</code> application is used for remote management of web applications. To use this application, you must add a user with role of
        <code>manager-gui</code> in <code>tomcat-users.xml</code>. Obviously, if you are not planning to use the <code>manager</code> application, it should be
        removed.
      </li>
      <li>The <code>host-manager</code> application is used for management of virtual hosts. To use this application, you must add a user with role of <code>admin-gui</code>
        in <code>tomcat-users.xml</code>. If you are not planning to do a lot of virtual hosting in Tomcat this application should be removed.
      </li>
      <li>The <code>examples</code> application should probably be removed from a production server to minimize security exposure.</li>
      <li>The <code>docs</code> are a copy of the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/">Tomcat documentation found online</a>. Unless you have need
        for a local copy, removing <code>docs</code> would help to tidy-up <code>${tomcat_home}/webapps</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>


</div>
<!-- end Removing Unused Web Applications section -->

<div id="section">
  <h2><a name="digested">Using Digested Passwords</a></h2>


  <h3>Rationale</h3>

  <div id="note" class="info">
    <h4>Tomcat Realms</h4>

    <p>A <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/realm.html">realm</a> element represents a "database" of usernames, passwords, and roles
      (similar to Unix groups) assigned to those users. </p>
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>Passwords stored in clear text are a vulnerability if the host is compromised.</li>
    <li>Better to have the passwords encrypted using a cryptographic hash functions (SHA, MD2, or MD5) and then stored in <code>tomcat-users.xml</code> file in
      the Tomcat <code>conf/</code> directory.
    </li>
    <li>Tomcat can be configured to support digested passwords (this is not the default setting).</li>
    <li>How it works: When a client makes a request Tomcat will tell the client that a digested password is required. Based on this dialog, the client will
      automatically digest the password entered by the user.
    </li>
  </ul>

<div id="section">
  <h2><a name="ssl">Enabling SSL Encryption</a></h2>

  <div id="note" class="info">
    <h4>How SSL works</h4>

    <p>For more information on how SSL works, Wikipedia details the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#How_it_works">steps
      involved</a> during an SSL transaction.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Rationale</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Communication between two servers can be intercepted (i.e., an http transaction between client and server).</li>
    <li>An attacker can eavesdrop on the conversation and control the relay of messages between the victims, making them believe that they are talking directly
      to each other over a private connection.
    </li>
    <li>The use of digital certificates adds a layer of security by allowing the receiver of the message to verify the sender is who he or she claims to be.
    </li>
    <li>Any intercepted information that is encrypted also adds a layer of security (the attacker must take the extra step of unencrypting the data to view the
      message).
    </li>
    <li>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and more recently Transport Layer Security (TLS), is a cryptographic protocol that provides security and data integrity for
      communications over TCP/IP networks.
    </li>
    <li>SSL allows applications to communicate across a network in a way designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.</li>
    <li>SSL uses a cryptographic system that uses two keys to encrypt data: a public key known to everyone and a private or secret key known only to the
      recipient of the message.
    </li>
    <li>By convention, URLs that require an SSL connection start with <code>https</code> instead of <code>http</code>.</li>
  </ul>


  <div id="note" class="info">
    <h4>CA-signed Certificates</h4>

    <p>A self-signed certificate says to your users <em>"Trust me - I am who I say I am."</em></p>

    <p>A certificate signed by a CA says, <em>"Trust me - the CA agrees I am who I say I am."</em></p>
  </div>

  <h3>SSL certificates</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A public key certificate is an electronic document which incorporates a digital signature to bind together a public key with identity information of the
      certificate user.
    </li>
    <li>The certificate can be used to verify that a public key belongs to an individual.</li>
    <li>The digital signature can be signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) or the certificate user (a self-signed certificate).</li>
    <li>Unidata <em>highly recommends</em> the use of a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA).</li>
    <li>Browser warnings for self-signed certificates can be very confusing to users and make them question the legitimacy of your web site.</li>
    <li>It's about trust: CA-signed certificates verify your identify to your users. If the traffic between your server and the client is intercepted, an
      attacker can inject their own self-signed cert in the place of yours and the visitor will likely not notice.
    </li>
    <li>Self-signed certificates cannot (by nature) be revoked, which may allow an attacker who has already gained access to monitor and inject data into a
      connection to spoof an identity if a private key has been compromised. CAs on the other hand have the ability to revoke a compromised certificate, which
      prevents its further use.
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Certificate <code>keystore</code> file</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A <code>keystore</code> file stores the details of the SSL certificate necessary to make the protocol secured.</li>
    <li>The Tomcat documentation includes a section on <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/ssl-howto.html#Prepare_the_Certificate_Keystore">importing
      your certificate into a keystore</a> file.
    </li>
    <li>Tomcat uses the <code>keystore</code> file for SSL transactions. Example:</li>
  </ul>
  <pre> &lt;Connector protocol=&quot;HTTP/1.1&quot; port=&quot;8443&quot; maxThreads=&quot;200&quot; 
    scheme=&quot;https&quot; secure=&quot;true&quot; SSLEnabled=&quot;true&quot;
    keystoreFile=&quot;${user.home}/.keystore&quot; 
    keystorePass=&quot;changeit&quot;
    clientAuth=&quot;false&quot; sslProtocol=&quot;TLS&quot;/&gt;</pre>

    Enabling SSL in Tomcat
  </a>


  <h3>Configuring web applications for SSL</h3>

  <div id="note" class="ahead">
    <h4>Looking Ahead</h4>

    <p>Other than the compelling security reasons, you will want to enable SSL to take advantage of a couple of monitoring and debugging tools: the
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/thredds/admin/debug">TDS Remote Management Tool</a>, and the <a href="tdsMonitor.html">TdsMonitor Tool</a> -- both of which
      (out-of-the-box) require SSL to access.</p>
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>The web application deployment descriptor, aka <code>web.xml</code>, specifies if all or parts of it need to be accessed via SSL.</li>
    <li>Deployment descriptors are found in the <code>WEB-INF</code> directory of the web application: <code>${tomcat_home}/webapps/application_name/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>.
    </li>
    <li>By convention, Tomcat and other servlet containers will read the web application deployment descriptors for initialization parameters and
      container-managed security constraints upon application deployment.
    </li>
    <li><em>The TDS has been pre-configured to require that SSL encryption is enabled in order to access the both the
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/thredds/admin/debug">TDS Remote Management Tool</a>, and the <a href="tdsMonitor.html">TdsMonitor Tool</a>.</em></li>
    <p><code>web.xml</code> from the TDS Remote Management Tool:</p>

  <h2><a name="proxy">Reverse Proxy</a></h2>

  <h3>Rationale</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A reverse proxy is a proxy server that appears to clients to be an ordinary server. Requests are forwarded to one or more origin servers which handle
      the request. The response is returned as if it came directly from the proxy server.
    </li>
    <img src="images/tds_reverse_proxy.png" alt="Reverse Proxy For The TDS">
    <li>Reverse proxies can be used to hide the existence and characteristics of the origin server(s) and can be an additional layer of defense and can protect
      against some OS and web server specific attacks. This additional security layer forces an attacker to attack the proxy because the firewall allows only
      the proxy to communicate with the back-end content servers.
    </li>
    <li>However, it does not provide any protection to attacks against vulnerabilities in the web application or proxy service itself (e.g., Apache, Tomcat).
    </li>
    <li>If an attacker can use the front-end proxy server to launch an attack on the back-end servers if he/she manages to exploit the web application, proxy
      transaction or some other service running on the proxy server.

  <h2><a name="jvm">Running Tomcat with a Security Manager</a></h2>

  <h3>Rationale</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The JVM Security Manager that comes with Tomcat imposes a fine-grained security restrictions to all Java applications running the JVM.</li>
    <li>It confines the Java applications in a sandbox, and restricts them from utilizing certain features of the Java language Tomcat normally is able to
      access.
    </li>
    <li>If you are hosting untrusted servlets or JSP on your server, then implementing the Security Manager may be a good idea.</li>
    <li>Be aware the Security Manager may prevent trusted web applications (like the TDS) from performing certain functions if configured too restrictively.

  <h2><a name="shutdown">Protecting the Tomcat <code>SHUTDOWN</code> Port</a></h2>

  <h3><code>SHUTDOWN</code> on port 8005</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tomcat uses a the default port of 8005 as the designated shutdown port. Shutdown scripts make a call to this port and issue the <code>SHUTDOWN</code>
      command.
    </li>
    <li>If need be, you can always change the shutdown command or even the port number in <code>${tomcat_home}/conf/server.xml</code>.</li>
