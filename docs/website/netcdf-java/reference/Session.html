<h2><a name="Intro"><u>Introduction</u></a></h2>
New public classes are introduced to the package ucar.httpclient.
These are
<em>HTTPSession.java</em>,
<em>HTTPMethod.java</em>,
<em>HTTPMethodStream.java</em>,
<em>HTTPException.java</em>,
<em>HttpClientManager.java</em>,
These classes are intended to wrap various Apache httpclient-3 library
classes so that (1) it will simplify use,
and (2) it will be possible to later switch to, say,
the Apache httpclient4 library.
<p>
  These classes support a form of <em>session</em>
  semantics for Java network access. The notion of session
  is only loosely tied to the HTTP notion of session.

<h3><a name="HTTPSession">HTTPSession and Session Semantics</a></h3>
A session is encapsulated in an instance of the class <em>HTTPSession</em>.
The encapsulation is with respect to a specific url.
This means that once a session is specified, it is tied permanently
to that url and <a href="#URLManagement">"compatible"</a> urls.
<p>
  It is important to note that Session objects do NOT correspond
  with the HttpClient objects of the Apache httpclient library.
  Each Session does, however, encapsulate an instance of an Apache HttpClient.

<p>
  It is possible to create a session with a null url, in which case,
  the session can be used generally.
  For this, an <em>HTTPSession</em> constructor with no arguments is provided.
  If used, then (1) the session is tied to no specific url,
  and (2) method creation must specify a url
  (see <a href="#HTTPMethod">HTTPMethod</a>).

<h3><a name="HTTPMethod">HTTPMethod</a></h3>
This class encapsulates the information
about a given method request and response.
Its primary operation is <em>execute()</em>,
which causes a request to be sent to a server
and a response obtained.
<p>
  The <em>HTTPMethod</em> class also operates as a factory for
  creating <em>HTTPMethod</em> instances. To create a method
  for doing an HTTP GET operation, for example, one would
  invoke this operation
<pre>
HTTPMethod m = HTTPMethod.Get(session);
</pre>
where "session" is a previously created session object.
<p>
  Alternately, one can create a method and specify a url.
<pre>
HTTPMethod m = HTTPMethod.Get(session,url);
</pre>
Note that any URL must be compatible
(See the Section on <a href="#URLManagement">URL Management</a>).

<h3><a name="HTTPMethodStream">HTTPMethodStream</a></h3>
The purpose of this class is to allow other classes to
access the data stream associated with a method response.
It tracks the method to allow it to be
closed when the stream hits eof or is explicitly closed.

<h3><a name="HTTPException">HTTPException</a></h3>
This class is a subclass of <em>java.io.IOException</em>.
It is the exception for reporting errors out of the
classes listed above.

<h3><a name="HttpClientManager">HttpClientManager</a></h3>
This class is a utility class to perform some specialized
actions. Its name begins with "Http" rather than
"HTTP" for historical reasons.
<p>
  This class contains only static methods and these methods
  perform the following utility operations.
<dl>
  <dt>Return the contents of a URL as a String
  <dd>
<pre>
String getUrlContentsAsString(String urlencoded, int maxKbytes)
</pre>
    Make a request on the specified url and return its response
    as a String of max length <em>maxKbytes</em>.
  <dt>Get the contents of URL and store in a file.
  <dd>
<pre>
void copyUrlContentsToFile(String urlencoded, File file) throws HTTPException
</pre>
    Make a request on the specified url, obtain its contents
    and write to the specified file.
  <dt>Append the contents of a URL to the end of a File
  <dd>
<pre>
long appendUrlContentsToFile(String url, File file, long start, long end)
</pre>
    Make a request on the specified url, obtain its contents
    and append to the specified file.
  <dt>Initialize the Client Manager class
  <dd>
<pre>
void init(CredentialsProvider provider, String userAgent)
</pre>
    Initialize to use a specified credentials provider and user agent
    when making requests.
</dl>

<h3><a name="URLManagement">URL Management</a></h3>
It is possible to specify a url in several places.
<ol>
  <li> It may be inherited from the URL specified when
    the session was created.
    <p>
      <li> It may be specified as part of the HTTPMethod
        constructor (via the factory). If none is specified,
        then the session URL is used.
        <p>
  <li> It may be specified as an argument to the
    execute() method. If none is specified, then
    the factory constructor URL is used (which might,
    in turn have come from the session).
</ol>
<p>
  Legal url arguments to the HTTPMethod factory call
  and execute() call are constrained by the URL
  specified in creating the HTTPSession instance, if any.
  If the session was constructed with a specified URL, then any
  url specified to HTTMethod (via the factory or via
  execute()) must be "compatible" with the session URL. The
  term "compatible" basically means that the session url, as a
  string, must be a prefix of the specified method url. This
  maintains the semantics of the Session but allows
  flexibility in accessing data from the server.
  As an example, if a session was created and specifed the URL
  "http://motherlode.ucar.edu", then any URL specified, in say,
  HTTPMethod.execute() must begin with the session URL.
  So, specifiying "http://motherlode.ucar.edu/path/file.nc.dds"
  would be a compatible url.
  Note that if the session was created with no url then a
  URL must be specified to the HTTPMethod object.

<p>
  There are some exceptions to the prefix rule for
  compatibility. Let <em>surl</em> be the session url and
  <em>murl</em> be the url specified for the method. The
  following rule holds.
<ul>
  <li>If the <em>surl</em> does not
    have a principal, then the <em>murl</em> without its principal
    is tested for compatibility.
    In effect, a missing principal
    acts like a wildcard.
    <p>
      Similarly, missing ports or paths
      in the <em>surl</em> also act like wildcards.
</ul>
<p>
  Additionally, and for backward compatibility, if <em>surl</em>
  is null or is the empty string (""), then any other url is
  considered compatible.

<h3><a name="SingleShot">Single Use Methods</a></h3>
A reasonably common use case is when a client
wants to create a method, execute it, get the response as a stream,
and pass the stream up to some higher level for use.
In this situation, it can be tricky to close the method
and the session objects properly because they will have
passed out of scope by the time the stream is read.
<p>
  To support this use case, HTTPMethod supports what amounts
  to a one-shot use. The steps are as follows:
<ol>
  <li> HTTPMethod method = HTTPMethod.Get().
    This implicitly creates a session internal to the
    method instance.
    <p>
      <li> Set any session parameters or headers using method.getSession().setXXX
        <p>
          <li> Set any parameters and headers on method
            <p>
              <li> method.execute(
                <url string
                );
                <p>
                  <li> Get any response method headers
                    <p>
                      <li> InputStream stream = method.getResponseBodyAsStream()
                        <p>
  <li> return the stream to higher levels to process.
</ol>
The first thing to note is that closing the stream
will automatically close the underlying method, so even though
the method object has passed out of scope, it will still get closed
when the stream is closed.
<p>
  The second thing to note is that when the method object
  uses an implicitly created session, closing the method
  will automatically close the session.

<p>
  The up shot is that closing the stream will cleanup the method
  and the (implicitly created) session even though they are out of
  scope.

<h3><u>Examples</u></h3>

<h4>Example 1: Create/Use/Release Cycle</h4>

<pre>
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] argv)
    {
	String url = argv[0];
        HTTPSession session = new HTTPSession(url);
        HTTPMethod method = HTTPMethod.Get(session);
        int status = method.execute();
        System.out.printf("Execute: status code = %d\n", status);

    }
}
</pre>

<h2><a name="Credentials"><u>Authorization Credentials</u></a></h2>
<em>HTTPSession</em>
operates in conjunction with the new credentialing mechanisms
to support better mechanisms for setting authorization credentials.
<p>
  The key idea is that a single, global database of credentials
  is maintained. The key for the database is the combination
  of the authorization scheme plus a url. This key pair maps
  to an instance of CredentialsProvider.
  At the time an HTTP method is executed, the url indicates
  when to apply authorization (if the server requests it).
  The scheme indicates the kind of authorization scheme
  is being used: HTTP Basic or Digest for example.
  The credentials provider is then invoked to compute the set
  of credentials to be sent to the server.

<p>
  Currently the following schemes are supported.

<p>
  <strong>Basic</strong>:
  the HTTP Basic scheme based on clear-text user name and password.

<p>
  <strong>Digest</strong>:
  the HTTP digest scheme based on encrypted user name and password.

<p>
  <strong>NTLM</strong>:
  the NTLM scheme is a Microsoft specific scheme. Support is provided,
  but has never been tested.

<p>
  <strong>SSL</strong>:
  a scheme that uses a client-side key to authenticate the
  client to the server. The ssl scheme is usually part of an
  SSL connection where the server authenticates to the client
  and then the client authenticates to the server.

<p>
  The credentials provider
  (see <a href="#HTTPSSLProvider.API">HTTPSSLProvider</a>)
  is used in a non-standard way and it contains the following information.
<ul>
  <li> The path to the keystore file
  <li> The password for decrypting the keystore file.
  <li> The path to a truststore file
  <li> The password for decrypting the truststore file.
</ul>
The last two items are optional. If missing, then the client will
accept any certificate sent to it by the server. This includes,
specifically, self-signed certificates.

<h4>Setting Credentials</h4>
There are four primary credentialling methods in
<em>HTTPSession</em>:
<ol>
  <li> Insert an arbitrary entry into the auth store.
    Its signature is as follows.
<pre>
static public void setAnyCredentialsProvider(HTTPAuthScheme scheme, String url,  CredentialsProvider provider)
</pre>
  <li> Set it for all sessions, which means it will be applied to any url
    unless overridden by a more specific entry in the auth store.
    Its signature is as follows.
<pre>
static public void setGlobalCredentialsProvider(HTTPAuthScheme scheme, CredentialsProvider provider)
</pre>
  <li> Set the credentials on a per-session basis, using the url
    defined for that session.
    Its signature is as follows.
<pre>
public void setCredentialsProvider(HTTPAuthScheme scheme, CredentialsProvider provider)
</pre>
  <li> Set the credentials on a per-session basis, using a client provided
    instance of <em>Credentials</em>. This is only useful when the credentials
    are unchanging.
    Its signature is as follows.
<pre>
public void setCredentials(HTTPAuthScheme scheme, Credentials creds);
</pre>

  <li> Set the credentials for all sessions
    using a client provided
    instance of <em>Credentials</em>. This is only useful when the credentials
    are unchanging.
    Its signature is as follows.
<pre>
public void setGlobalCredentials(HTTPAuthScheme scheme, Credentials creds);
</pre>
</ol>
<p>
  For backward compatibility, the following two methods are defined.
  They use the Basic scheme for the scheme.
<ol>
  <li>
<pre>
static public void setGlobalCredentialsProvider(CredentialsProvider provider)
</pre>
  <li>
<pre>
public void setCredentialsProvider(CredentialsProvider provider)
</pre>
</ol>

<h2><a name="Noapi"><u>Command Line Access to the Authorization Mechanism</u></a></h2>
Before the introduction of the authorization mechanisms described
in this document, it was possible to specify the
keystore+password and the truststore+password
using the command line flags
<pre>
-Dkeystore
-Dkeystorepassword
-Dtruststore
-Dtruststorepassword
</pre>
For purposes of backward compatibility, a check is made for these
flags, and if they are defined, then
an entry equivalent to the following is inserted into the auth store.
<pre>
insert(new Entry(HTTPAuthScheme.SSL,ANY_URL,
                 new HTTPSSLProvider(keystore,kpassword,
                                     truststore,trustpassword)));
</pre>

<h3><a name="Proxy"><u>Proxy Support</u></a></h2>
  There are two kinds of proxy support: authenticating and
  simple (i.e. not authenticating).
  Both kinds of proxies require the specification of a host name
  and a port. In addition, authenticating proxies require the
  specification of some form of credentials/credentialsprovider.
  The authenticating proxy usually occurs as a corporate or
  governmental firewall controlling access to the "outside world".
  <p>
    Specifying the host plus port can be done in either of two ways.
  <ol>
    <li> Programmatically by called the procedure
      <a href="#setGlobalProxy">HTTPSession.setGlobalProxy()</a>.
<p>
<li> Global command line parameters: 
"-Dhttp.proxyHost" and "-Dhttp.proxyPort"; note that this is
      equivalent to calling <a href="#setGlobalProxy">setGlobalProxy()</a>
with the values of the
http.proxyhost 
and the 
http.proxyport
command line parameters
</ol>
<p>
For authentication, the authentication database is consulted to try
to locate the proper credentials for the proxy machine.
<p>
Also note that one can set the username and password into
the url used to establish an HTTPSession instance.
Note that one should not use the url of the proxy
but rather the url of the target server from which one is
trying to obtain information.
<pre>
http://username@pwd:server.com/...
</pre>
This will only work if the proxy is authenticating using BASIC
authentication. If it uses, for example, NTLM, then you will
need to set the authentication programmatically.

<h2><a name=" Misc"><u>Miscellaneous Changes</u></a></h2>
      As a side effect of the insertion of the auth mechanisms,
      a number of miscellaneous changes also occurred.
      <ol>
        <li> HttpClientManager class was moved to the same
          package as HTTPSession, namely ucar.httpclient.
      </ol>

  <li> void setFollowRedirects(boolean tf)
</ul>

<h4>Request Header Set/Get</h4>
<ul>
  <li> void setMethodHeaders(List
    <Header> headers) throws HTTPException
      <li> void setRequestHeader(String name, String value) throws HTTPException
      <li> void setRequestHeader(Header h) throws HTTPException
      <li> Header getRequestHeader(String name)
      <li> Header[] getRequestHeaders()
</ul>

<h4>Reponse Header Get</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Header getResponseHeader(String name)

  <li> void setMultipartRequest(Part[] parts) throws HTTPException
</ul>
</ul>

<h3><u><a name="HTTPMethodStream.API">HTTPMethodStream API</a></u></h3>
This class subclasses <em>java.io.InputStream</em>
and provides the <em>InputStream</em> interface.
In addition, if the stream is closed, then the
underlying method is closed as well.

<h3><u><a name="HTTPSSLProvider.API">HTTPSSLProvider API</a></u></h3>
Since no existing <em>CredentialsProvider</em> implementation
exists to support the SSL scheme,
the <em>HTTPSSLProvider</em> class is provided for that purpose.
Its constructor requires arguments for
the client side keystore plus password and the client side
truststore plus password.
The keystore and truststore arguments are absolute paths.
<h4>Constructor(s)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>HTTTPSSLProvider(String keystore,String keypass, String truststore, String trustpass)
    <ul>
      <li> Creates an SSL provider that uses the client side key in the
        keystore and validates the server-side certificate using the
        truststore. If the truststore is null, then any certificate
        presented by the server will be accepted.
    </ul>
    <p>
      <li> HTTPSSLProvider()
        <ul>
          <li> Equivalent to HTTPSSLProvider(null,"",null,"");
        </ul>
        <p>
          <li> HTTPSSLProvider(String keystore, String keypass)
            <ul>
              <li> Equivalent to HTTPSSLProvider(keystore,keypass,null,"");
            </ul>
    <p>
</ul>
<h4>Credentials Provider Interface</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Credentials getCredentials(AuthScheme authscheme,
    String host,
    int port,
    boolean isproxy)<br>
    throws CredentialsNotAvailableException
    <ul>
      <li> This function is here only to satisfy the interface
        and will never be invoked.
    </ul>
</ul>
