<h1>NetCDF-4 C Library Loading</h1>

<p>In order to write NetCDF-4 files, you must have the <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">NetCDF-4
    C library</a>&mdash;version 4.3.1 or above&mdash;available on your system, along with all supporting libraries
    (HDF5, zlib, etc). The details of this differ for each operating system, and our experience (so far) is documented
    below.</p>

<h2><a name="installation" id="installation">Installation</a></h2>

<p>For all platforms, we strongly recommend 64-bit Java, if you can run it. Also, be sure to use the latest version, as
    security improvements are constantly being made.</p>

<h3><a name="installation_windows" id="installation_windows">Windows</a></h3>

<p>The simplest option is to download and install one of the <a
        href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/winbin.html">pre-built binaries</a>. If you're feeling
    intrepid, it's also possible to <a
            href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/getting_and_building_netcdf.html#netCDF-CMake">build
        from source</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="installation_linux" id="installation_linux">Linux</a></h3>

<p>The easiest way to get NetCDF is through a package management program, such as rpm, yum, adept, and others. Details
    will vary with each program but &quot;netcdf&quot; is usually the package name you want. Of course, it's also
    possible to build from source, as described <a
            href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/getting_and_building_netcdf.html">here</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="installation_linux_hdf5" id="installation_linux_hdf5">A note on HDF5</a></h4>

<p>When building HDF5, you <strong>must</strong> do so with both the <code>--enable-threadsafe</code> and <code>--with-pthread=DIR</code>
    options. The <code>--with-pthread</code> option must point to the directory that contains the POSIX Threads library
    install (<code>[DIR]/includes/pthread.h</code>, <code>[DIR]/lib/libpthread*</code>). For more information, please
    see the <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf5-quest.html#mthread">HDF5 FAQ</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="installation_mac" id="installation_mac">Mac</a></h3>

<p>The installation process is hopefully similar to Linux. <a
        href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/support/help/MailArchives/netcdf/msg11807.html">Here</a> is a support question
    that may be useful.</p>

<h2><a name="loading" id="loading">Loading</a></h2>

<p>In order to use NetCDF-4, the CDM must know the location of the &quot;netcdf&quot; shared library, as well as the
    location(s) of its dependencies. These files will have different extensions depending on your platform:</p>

<ul>
    <li>On Windows, they will be .DLL files.</li>
    <li>On Linux, they will be .SO files.</li>
    <li>On Mac, they will be .DYLIB files.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several ways to specify their locations.</p>

<h3><a name="loading_preferred" id="loading_preferred">Preferred method (requires NetCDF-Java 4.5.4 or later)</a></h3>

<p>Set the system library path. This is the path that the OS will search whenever it needs to find a shared library that
    it doesn't already know the location of. It is not Java-, NetCDF-, or CDM-specific. As usual, details will vary with
    each platform.</p>

<h4><a name="loading_preferred_windows" id="loading_preferred_windows">Windows</a></h4>

<p>The system library path maps to the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. To find NetCDF-4 and its dependencies,
    you'll want to add <code>$NC4_INSTALL_DIR/bin</code>, <code>$NC4_INSTALL_DIR/deps/$ARCH/bin</code>, and
    <code>$NC4_INSTALL_DIR/deps/$ARCH/lib</code> to the <code>PATH</code> variable. <code>NC4_INSTALL_DIR</code>
    is the location where you installed the C library and <code>ARCH</code> is its architecture
    (either &quot;w32&quot; or &quot;x64&quot;).</p>

<h4><a name="loading_preferred_linux" id="loading_preferred_linux">Linux</a></h4>

<p>The system library path maps to the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable. If you used the default
    installation directory when building, NetCDF-4 and its dependencies will all be in <code>/usr/local/lib</code>. If
    you got NetCDF from a package manager, it'll likely have been installed elsewhere.</p>

<h4><a name="loading_preferred_mac" id="loading_preferred_mac">Mac</a></h4>

<p>The system library path maps to the <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable.</p>

<p>TODO: Where is NetCDF typically installed on Mac?</p>

<h3><a name="loading_alternate" id="loading_alternate">Alternate methods</a></h3>

<p>The following alternatives are Java- and/or CDM-specific. To use these, <strong>it is required that NetCDF and all of
    its dependencies live in the same directory</strong>. So, if that is not the case in your current configuration, you
    must manually copy them all to the same place. This is a particular issue on Windows, because the libraries are
    guaranteed to be in separate locations by default.</p>

<p>In addition to the library path, the CDM also needs to know the library name. This is almost always &quot;netcdf&quot;,
    unless you've renamed it.</p>

<ul>
    <li>For TDS users, we recommend setting the library path and name in the <a
            href="../../tds/reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile.html#netcdfCLibrary">THREDDS configuration file</a>.
    </li>
    <li>For standalone CDM library use, you can
        <ul>
            <li>create a system environment variable: <code>JNA_PATH=/path/to/library</code></li>
            <li>set a Java property on the command line: <code>-Djna.library.path=/path/to/library</code></li>
            <li>set the library path and name in the <a href="RuntimeLoading.html#XML">runtime configuration file</a>
            </li>
            <li>directly call <a
                    href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/javadocAll/ucar/nc2/jni/netcdf/Nc4Iosp.html#setLibraryAndPath(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)">Nc4Iosp.setLibraryAndPath()</a>
                from your Java program
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="loading_troubleshooting" id="loading_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h3>

<p>If you get a message like this:</p>

<pre>
 Warning! ***HDF5 library version mismatched error***
 The HDF5 header files used to compile this application do not match
 the version used by the HDF5 library to which this application is linked.
 Data corruption or segmentation faults may occur if the application continues.
 This can happen when an application was compiled by one version of HDF5 but
 linked with a different version of static or shared HDF5 library.
 You should recompile the application or check your shared library related
 settings such as 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH'.
 You can, at your own risk, disable this warning by setting the environment
 variable 'HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK' to a value of '1'.
 Setting it to 2 or higher will suppress the warning messages totally.
 Headers are 1.8.10, library is 1.8.5
 Bye...
</pre>

<p>Make sure that you don't have an old version of the HDF5 library in your system library path.</p>

<h2><a name="writing" id="writing">Writing NetCDF-4 files</a></h2>

<ul>
    <li>From the command line: see <a href="manPages.html#nccopy">nccopy man page</a></li>
    <li>From ToolsUI: in <strong>Viewer</strong> tab, bring up the file to copy, then click &quot;Write netCDF file&quot;
        button to get dialog.
    </li>
    <li>From TDS NetCDF Subset Service: choose <strong>netcdf-4</strong> output type.</li>
    <li>From a Java program (see <em>ucar.nc2.dataset.NetcdfDataset.main()</em> for complete example) :
<pre>Nc4Chunking chunker = Nc4Chunking factory(Strategy type, int deflateLevel, boolean shuffle);
NetcdfFileWriter.Version version = NetcdfFileWriter.Version.netcdf4;

FileWriter2 writer = new ucar.nc2.FileWriter2(ncfileIn, filenameOut, version, chunker);
...
NetcdfFile ncfileOut = writer.write();
ncfileIn.close();<br/>ncfileOut.close();
</pre>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Chunking Strategy (version 4.5)</h3>

<p>When writing NetCDF-4 files, one must decide on how the variables are to be chunked. In the NetCDF-Java library this
    is done through the use of a Nc4Chunking strategy. The possibilities currently are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>standard</strong> : this strategy is used by default (see below for description)</li>
    <li><strong>grib</strong>: this strategy matches how GRIB files are stored: the chunking uses only the two rightmost
        dimensions, which for GRIB is the x and y dimension. Use this strategy when converting GRIB files to NetCDF-4,
        in order to optimize conversion writing time, and to get similar access speed.
    </li>
    <li><strong>custom</strong>: you may write your own inplementation of <strong>ucar.nc2.write.Nc4Chunking</strong>
        and pass it into <strong>FileWriter2</strong> or <strong>NetcdfFileWriter</strong>. This gives you complete
        control over chunking.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Both <strong>standard</strong> and <strong>grib</strong> strategies allow you to override individual variable
    chunking if you want by setting the variable's <strong>_ChunkSizes </strong>attribute. </p>

<p><strong>By default, the Java library will write chunked and compressed NetCDF-4 files</strong>, using the default
    chunking algorithm. You may pass in a null for the chunking parameter to use the default.</p>

<h3><a name="chunking" id="chunking">Default chunking strategy</a></h3>

<p>For each Variable:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Look for a variable attribute named &quot;<strong>_ChunkSizes&quot;</strong>, whose value is a vector of integer
        chunk sizes, one for each dimension. If it
        exists, use it.
    </li>
    <li>If the variable does not have an unlimited dimension:
        <ul>
            <li> it will be chunked if the total size in bytes &gt; <strong>Nc4ChunkingDefault.minVariableSize</strong>
            </li>
            <li>chunk size will be <em><strong>fillFastest</strong></em><strong></strong>( variable.shape, <strong>Nc4ChunkingDefault.defaultChunkSize</strong>)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If the variable has one or more unlimited dimensions, it will be chunked, and the chunk size will be calculated
        as:
        <ol>
            <li>set unlimited dimensions to length one, then compute
                <em><strong>fillFastest</strong></em><strong></strong>( variable.shape, <strong>Nc4ChunkingDefault.defaultChunkSize</strong>)
            </li>
            <li>if the resulting chunk size is greater than <strong>Nc4ChunkingDefault.minChunksize</strong>, use it
            </li>
            <li>if not, set the unlimited dimension chunk sizes so that the resulting chunksize is close to <strong>Nc4ChunkingDefault.minChunksize. </strong>If
                there are N unlimited dimensions, take the Nth root, ie evenly divide the chunk size among the unlimited
                dimensions.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The <em><strong>fillFastest</strong></em><strong></strong>( int[] shape,<strong> maxSize</strong>) algorithm fills
    the fastest varying (rightmost) dimensions first, until the chunkSize is as close to <strong>maxSize</strong> as
    possible without exceeding. The net effect is that the chunkSizes will be close to <strong>Nc4ChunkingDefault.defaultChunkSize</strong>,
    with a minimum of <strong>Nc4ChunkingDefault.minChunksize</strong>, and favoring read access along the fast
    dimensions. Any variable with an unlimited dimension will use at least
    <strong>Nc4ChunkingDefault.minChunksize</strong> bytes (approx, but if compressing, unused space should be mostly
    eliminated).</p>

<p>Current default values (these can be overidden by the user):</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>minVariableSize</strong> = 65K</li>
    <li><strong>defaultChunkSize</strong> = 256K</li>
    <li><strong>minChunksize</strong> = 8K</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, compression (deflate level = 5) and the shuffle filter will be used. The user can override these by:</p>

<pre>
// set deflate &gt; 0 to compress
// set shuffle to true for the shuffle filter 
Nc4Chunking chunker = Nc4Chunking factory(Nc4Chunking.Strategy.standard, int deflateLevel, boolean shuffle);
</pre>
